## Data exploration


### Dataset analysis

Results of visual dataset inspection are stored in `extended_scored.csv`, 
in which we added a flag `usable` that is 0 if an image is not a galaxy-like object but rather a cat, a tree etc.

Data analysis and data visualisation can be found in the jupyter notebook `image_analysis.ipynb`.
